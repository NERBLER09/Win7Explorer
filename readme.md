# Windows 7 Explorer
This was created as a very simple file browser to recreate the look and feel of the Windows Explorer in Windows 7 as I was not really liking the default file explorer in Windows 10.

Created in Electron JS with Svelte and 7.css.

## Setting Up For Development 
In order to run a development version of the app, you'll have to have Node JS install.

When you have the repo cloned, run:
```
$ npm i
# then
$ npm start 
```
